    "As we've seen in previous lessons, at it's core, programming is simply a computer executing a series of instructions. However, programs can quickly become sophisticated and implement complex logical processes by using the output generated through the program to decide whether to skip instructions, repeat them or choose a specific segment of code to run.  In general, a programmer would rarely want their programs to start from the first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. Flow control statements can decide which Python instructions to execute under which specific conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of flow control as a way to programmatically navigate through a flowchart from start to end. In a flowchart there are generally more than one way to go from the starting point to the end point and the direction traveled through the flowchart is based on the answers given at each stage.\n",

This allows us to create conditional statements of any complexity. We can chain a large number of comparison operators together to control the flow of logic through our programs as accurately as we desire. Similarly to the mathematical operations, the Boolean operators always evaluate the ```not``` operators first before the ```and``` or ```or``` operators. It is generally good practise to wrap each comparison operator in brackets to make the code more readable.
