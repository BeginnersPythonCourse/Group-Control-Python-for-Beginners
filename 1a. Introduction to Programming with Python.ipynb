    "Hello and welcome to the Group Control Python Training Cohort for March 2025!\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, thank you very much for taking the time to participate in this course, we hope to be able to provide a brief but thorough introduction to programming with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we will look to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduction to Programming - What it is & Why it's Useful. \n",
    "- Python Data Types & Variables.\n",
    "- Comparison & Boolean Operators.\n",
    "- Using Python to Control Logic Flow.\n",
    "- Defining Functions and Error Handling.\n",
    "- Lists and a simple Data Cleaning Example. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the course of these lessons, we will include lots of examples that show the utility of Programming and how Python can be used to automate and simplify everyday tasks in Barclays."

    "## What is Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very simply put, computer programming is simply giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. Computers are extremely quick at performing calculations or logical operations but for the user to receive any form of meaningful result, computers need to be given specific and accurate instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming can be thought of in the similar way to a chef cooking from a recipe, where the chef is the computer and the recipe's author is the programmer. A chef can perform any kitchen task quickly and effectively but without ingredients and specific instructions, the chef won't be able to produce the desired meal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a computer programmer has created a program, or recipe, each step needs to be translated into instructions that the computer can understand and interpret- this step is called coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming can be thought of as the mental thought process used to provide instructions for a machine (like a computer) but coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is always important to remember that no matter how complex a computer program can become, when broken down each computer program is simply a set of simple mathematical and logical operations performed in succession. As a developer, when approaching a challenging problem, it is always useful to try to break the problem down into the necessary individual operations which can be put together to construct the final solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like human languages, the same programming instructions can be translated into code in many ways using many different programming languages, each of which will have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an example of a very popular programming language as it is thought to be a versatile, general-purpose programming language which provides a good compromise between quick execution and human readability/interpretability."

    "## Why Should You Learn Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programming helps develop and hone a developer's problem-solving skills, as mentioned above, a key skill in programming is breaking down large, complex problems into smaller parts and solving them individually. This also helps programmers build strong and versatile logical thinking skills that can be applied to a wide variety of disciplines.\n",
    "- One of the main benefits of programming is learning to create processes that will automate repetitive & time-consuming tasks, which can save valuable time and financial resources.\n",
    "- Furthermore, automation often reduces the possibility of human error occurring when time-consuming, repetitive tasks are being completed.\n",
    "- Programming is seen as a desirable skill and Python is one of the most widely used languages, so it is a great place to get started. \n",
    "- Technology fields such as data and computer science are constantly evolving. This allows programmers the ability to always learn new skills and technologies which encourages lifelong learning, development and personal growth. \n",
    "- Finally, although programming can sometimes be challenging, the problem-solving required can often be very fun and satisfying, and allows programmers to think creatively to solve many complex problems."

    "## Important to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the first lesson, I would just like to reiterate that, especially in the beginning, learning programming can be challenging. Many people will have been put off learning to program as the technology is unfamiliar at first and it can feel like a steep learning curve. However, I would really like to encourage you all to stick with it, go slowly in the beginning so you can really learn the fundamentals and make sure to ask any questions that you might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the trainers in the course (myself included) and fellow colleagues are fully self-taught programmers and have started in the exact same position as everyone in this cohort. All of us have thoroughly enjoyed learning to program and have appreciated the benefits that coding has brought to us, both in terms of our careers and skills development.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of us will be more than happy to assist with any questions you may have or clarify any details explained in the course. Please let the team know if you have any feedback or questions related to the content, we will be happy to answer all of the questions submitted. Also don't forget that Google is a programmerâ€™s best friend, don't be afraid to search up any questions you might have, every programmer does it! This also applies to using any generative AI tools that you might have access to! \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'd just like to reiterate that the aim of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of programming and encourage participants to begin learning how to use Python. As much as we would love everyone to begin using Python in their daily roles,  please seek approval from your team managers to ensure that it is suitable for your individual role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks again for joining. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the course!"
