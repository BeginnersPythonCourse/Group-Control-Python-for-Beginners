    "To recap, we have now covered Python Data Types & Variables, Mathematical, Comparison & Boolean operators, and how Python reads and processes programs. We have covered many of the basics, and if we understand these fundamentals thoroughly, it will allow us to start creating sophisticated & exciting programs. As mentioned previously, based on Boolean values or the outputs of operators, Python can choose to run a section of code multiple times, only execute certain parts of the code, or skip sections of code entirely. This functionality in Python is called *Flow Control Statements*, and they are the implementation of the decisions that are taken at each stage in a flow diagram."

    "## Blocks of Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we introduce our first flow control statement, it's important to introduce the concepts of a *block of code* and *indentation*. In programming, whitespace and when text starts on a line are important. An indentation in Python is created by pressing 'Tab' on the keyboard and looks equivalent to inputting 4 spaces at the start of a line of code. Indentations are used to separate blocks of code and distinguish parts of code in the program as being separate from each other. They also create much more readable code as the distinct sections are clearly split up and distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks of Code in Python follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blocks begin when the indentation increases.\n",
    "- Blocks can contain other blocks.\n",
    "- Blocks end when the indentation returns to where it was before the block started.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example of indentation contains an *if* statement, which we will cover very shortly."

    "## If Else Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common types of flow control statements is the ```if``` statement (see above for example). The block of code indented after an ```if``` statement will execute if the condition contained within the ```if``` statement is ```True```. Translated into English, if statements can be read as \"If this condition is true, execute the following code block.\" All flow control statements generally follow a similar structure, but if statements specifically contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ```if``` keyword.\n",
    "- An expression which will either resolve to  ```True``` or ```False```.\n",
    "- A colon.\n",
    "- Starting on the next line, an indented block of code which will be executed if the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the following line defines an if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (userName == \"Barclays123\"):\n",
    "    *BLOCK OF CODE*\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is an if statement as it contains the ```if``` keyword, an expression which can either evaluate to ```True``` or ```False```, a colon, and then is followed by an indented block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "An if clause can optionally be followed by an ```else``` statement. The else clause is executed only when the if statementâ€™s condition is False. In English, an else statement could be read as, \"If this condition is true, execute this code. Or else, execute that code.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An else statement contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ```else``` keyword.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elif Statements \n",
    "\n",
    "If-Else statements are perfect if we only want to execute one of two options, however, there are plenty of instances where we might want to execute a different code block for more than two possibilities. The ```elif``` statement is an \"else if\" statement that always follows an if or another elif statement and comes before the final else statement. It provides another condition that is checked only if all the previous conditions were ```False```. \n",
