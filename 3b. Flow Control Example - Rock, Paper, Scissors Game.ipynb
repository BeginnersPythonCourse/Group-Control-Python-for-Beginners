    "### Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding out this game, we need to briefly introduce the concept of *importing modules* in Python. As we've seen, Python comes with a basic set of in-built functions such as ```print()```, ```len()``` and ```input()``` which we can use straight away in any Python script. Python also comes with a set of *modules* which contain additional functions called the *standard library*. A *module* is a Python program which contains a related group of functions that we can use in our own programs. For example, the ```random``` module has random number-related functions and ```math``` has mathematically related functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import and use functions from modules, we use the *import* keyword followed by the name of the module at the start of the code."
