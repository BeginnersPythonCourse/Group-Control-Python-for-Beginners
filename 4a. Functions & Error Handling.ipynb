We've also been introduced to the language used when working with functions in programming, whether we're *calling* a function or *passing* an *argument* into a function, functions are one of the most useful aspects of programming, so in this lesson, we're going to learn how to define and use our own functions in Python. \n",

    "- In the example above, we have defined a function called ```Greet_User```. A new function is initiated by using the ```def``` keyword. \n",
    "- Similar to variable names, function names cannot contain spaces, are case-sensitive, and must start with either a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "- The brackets after the function name contain the *arguments* which are passed into the function. These are the values that can be changed to influence the value(s) outputted by the function. In the example above, when calling the function we need to provide a name, age and a Boolean value indicating if the person is a Barclays Employee or not. Depending on the values that we input into the function, we receive a greeting including the name and age of the input, and depending on whether the input Boolean value is ```True``` or ```False```, we get a different output message. \n",
    "- To *call* the newly-created function, we need to type the function name and place the values we would like to enter into the function in brackets, in the order that they are defined in the function definition. \n",
    "- If we wanted to call the ```Greet_User``` function again but for someone called \"Sally\", who's 40 years old and doesn't work for Barclays we could write the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Greet_User(\"Sally\", 40, False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the main benefits of function calling, as it makes running similar chunks of code quick, easy, and readable. For example, if we wanted to greet another 10 people with the same output, using the function defined above, this is only 10 additional lines of code, whereas in the initial example, this would be over 50 additional lines!\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, functions are great as they make updating code logic quicker and easier. If we wanted to change a single line of output in the ```Greet_User``` function, we would only need to alter a single line of code in the block of code contained in the function and the change would automatically be implemented every time the function is called. If we wanted to replicate the same change in the original code, we would have to make the same output change as many times in the code as there are outputs that we've manually defined. For example, if we wanted the first ```print()``` statement to say \n",
    "\n",
    "```print(\"Howdy, Nice to meet you \" + Name + \"!\")``` instead of ```    print(\"Hello \" + Name + \" it's Lovely to meet you!\")```\n",

    "we only have to change a single line in the ```Greet_User()``` function but in the original script we have to change three lines (and make sure the variable names match up accurately for each line of output).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible when defining functions to introduce an argument in the function definition that already has a value inputted which, unless the argument is overwritten when the function is called, will automatically take the default argument given. This allows extra flexibility when defining functions, especially when the functionality needed is often the same and only occasionally needs to change. Adding a default argument into a function definition is simple: include the default argument in the function parenthesis and use the assignment operator to set the default value.\n",
