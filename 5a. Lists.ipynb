    "The most widely utilised and versatile data structure is a *list* which contains multiple values in an *ordered* sequence. Lists are defined by *square brackets* and each individual element in a list is separated by a comma.

    "This is a great example of showing how programming can automate repetitive tasks to create results almost instantaneously. If I were to work out manually if 20 integers were prime by checking if each of those factors divided each input number, it would take me a significant amount of time. It would also introduce a large element of human error into the processing, as it's likely that at some point in the large number of calculations I would make a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this example shows the utility of lists. If I wanted to check if any more numbers are prime, I would simply have to add them to the ```inputNumbers``` list. Similarly, I could quickly include more or fewer values in the list of factors to make our prime number approximator more or less accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be quite common when working with data to have datasets with thousands or millions of values in a column. To manually do calculations on this scale quickly becomes infeasible; however, with programming, we can do this quickly, easily, and accurately with relatively simple code."
